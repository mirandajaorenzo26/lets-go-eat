## Overview

### The challenge

- Shuffle and Choose Mode: This mode allows users to choose from a virtual deck of cards. It gives you the opportunity to make a deliberate choice by shuffling the options and selecting one from the deck.

- Random Picker Mode: In this mode, the application takes charge of decision-making. If you're looking for a random selection or simply want the application to decide for you, this mode will come in handy. Activate it, and the application will provide a random selection on your behalf.
